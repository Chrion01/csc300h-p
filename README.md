## Approach

Following the guide lines of the weekly checkins, we produced code to do what was specified, usually 1 node visitor class per task and a higher level visitor to co-ordinate the results and execution of the tasks. The end result is somewhat hap hazard and difficult to read. 

## Difficulties

1. We could not test the code on CDF computers as we could not get pycparser on them.
2. Co-ordination was difficult as free time between group members did not overlap most of the weekdays.
3. Poor code readibilty hampered multi person efforts and results in individuals handling sections by themselves.
4. Combining 2 & 3 results in spending time bringing each other up to speed on changes made and discouraged making changes on their own without consulting the original writer.
5. Lack of leadership meant issues 2-4 continued throughout the process.
6. Guidelines issued on Mondays and due on Fridays meant 2 and 5 was more problematic than it was for the assignments.
